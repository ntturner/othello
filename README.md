# Othello

The game that takes "a minute to learn, a lifetime to master." This is my final project for the IS 590R Android App Development course, Winter 2020. It works great on my Samsung Galaxy S5 and my Pixel 2 emulator. I have not tested this on iOS.

I had a lot of fun making this and I am very happy with how it turned out. Enjoy!
